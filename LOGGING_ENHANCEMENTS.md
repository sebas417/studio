# AuthContext.tsx Logging Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced logging statements have been added to `AuthContext.tsx` to help debug login issues on mobile web browsers. These improvements provide comprehensive debugging information for authentication flows, device detection, and error scenarios.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Mobile Device Detection Logging
- **Location**: `isMobileDevice()` function
- **Improvements**:
  - Detailed device information logging including user agent, screen dimensions, touch capabilities
  - Platform and vendor information
  - Device pixel ratio for high-DPI displays
  - Clear distinction between mobile user agent detection and touch/screen size fallback

### 2. AuthProvider Initialization Logging
- **Location**: `AuthProvider` component initialization
- **Improvements**:
  - Logs when AuthProvider is initialized
  - Includes timestamp, client-side detection, user agent, and current URL
  - Helps identify SSR vs client-side rendering issues

### 3. Enhanced Auth State Change Logging
- **Location**: `onAuthStateChanged` callback
- **Improvements**:
  - Comprehensive user information logging (uid, email, display name, verification status)
  - Provider data information
  - Timestamps for all auth state changes
  - Clear distinction between authenticated and unauthenticated states

### 4. Detailed Redirect Result Handling
- **Location**: `handleRedirectResult` function
- **Improvements**:
  - Logs when checking for redirect results
  - Detailed success information including user data and operation type
  - Enhanced error logging with stack traces, custom data, and context
  - User agent and URL information for error scenarios

### 5. Comprehensive Sign-In Flow Logging
- **Location**: `signInWithGoogle` function
- **Improvements**:
  - Step-by-step logging of the sign-in process
  - Browser capabilities logging (cookies, storage, network status, etc.)
  - Device-specific flow logging (mobile redirect vs desktop popup)
  - Detailed error handling with context and fallback scenarios

### 6. Enhanced Error Logging
- **Improvements across all functions**:
  - Structured error objects with code, message, stack trace
  - Timestamp and user agent information
  - Custom data and context information
  - Clear error categorization and handling

### 7. Sign-Out Process Logging
- **Location**: `signOutUser` function
- **Improvements**:
  - Logs sign-out initiation and completion
  - Error handling with detailed context

## Logging Categories

### Device Detection
```javascript
[AuthContext] Device Detection Details: {
  userAgent: "...",
  isMobileUA: boolean,
  isTouchDevice: boolean,
  isSmallScreen: boolean,
  screenWidth: number,
  screenHeight: number,
  maxTouchPoints: number,
  devicePixelRatio: number,
  platform: string,
  vendor: string
}
```

### Browser Capabilities
```javascript
[AuthContext] Browser capabilities: {
  cookieEnabled: boolean,
  onLine: boolean,
  language: string,
  languages: string[],
  doNotTrack: string,
  hardwareConcurrency: number,
  deviceMemory: string,
  connection: object,
  storage: {
    localStorage: boolean,
    sessionStorage: boolean,
    indexedDB: boolean
  },
  location: {
    protocol: string,
    host: string,
    pathname: string
  }
}
```

### Auth State Changes
```javascript
[AuthContext] Auth state changed: {
  hasUser: boolean,
  userId: string,
  email: string,
  displayName: string,
  emailVerified: boolean,
  isAnonymous: boolean,
  providerData: array,
  timestamp: string
}
```

### Error Logging
```javascript
[AuthContext] Error during [operation]: {
  code: string,
  message: string,
  stack: string,
  customData: any,
  timestamp: string,
  userAgent: string,
  url?: string
}
```

## Benefits for Mobile Debugging

1. **Device Identification**: Clear logging helps identify device type and capabilities
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Logs browser features that might affect authentication
3. **Network Conditions**: Connection information helps debug network-related issues
4. **Error Context**: Detailed error information with device and browser context
5. **Flow Tracking**: Step-by-step logging helps track authentication flow progression
6. **Timing Information**: Timestamps help identify timing-related issues

## Usage

All logging uses the `[AuthContext]` prefix for easy filtering in browser developer tools. To view authentication logs:

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Filter by `[AuthContext]` to see only authentication-related logs
4. Monitor logs during sign-in/sign-out operations

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

The enhanced logging specifically addresses common mobile web browser issues:
- Popup blocking detection and fallback logging
- Touch device detection accuracy
- Screen size and orientation handling
- Mobile browser capability detection
- Redirect flow monitoring
- Storage availability checking

These enhancements provide comprehensive debugging information to help identify and resolve authentication issues on mobile web browsers.
